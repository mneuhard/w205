Query Run:
select mname, (sq.pmMax-sq.pmMin) as pmDiff from (select pm.measurename mname, min(pm.measureScore) as pmMin, max(pm.measureScore) as pmMax from procedureMeasures pm where  pm.measureScore is not NULL group by pm.measurename order by pmMax DESC) sq order by pmDiff Desc limit 10;

Conclusion:
The best choice for variability was range since we assume that each procedure is weighted the same (i.e. a life or death situation is equal to a regular procedure).  For the variability measure we did not have to look at the actual hospital, we were looking for variability across hospitals.  So a simple range of the max vs the min gives us the greated variability across procedures.    There is some very large variability in some procedures, we looked at the Data Dictionary to see if there was a range defined and could not find one, which meant we had to trust the data, although it does look like there could be some outliers.
